- shot: 12719 occurrences
- carry: 10179 occurrences
- controlledexit: 5750 occurrences

MARKOV CHAIN INSIGHTS:
1. Passing sequences that follow the pattern of [describe pattern] have the highest probability of creating quality scoring chances.
2. The transition from controlledentry to shot is particularly effective, occurring in many goal sequences.
3. Teams should focus on maintaining possession through pass in the offensive zone.
4. Quick transitions from controlledentry to shots are more effective than extended passing sequences in certain situations.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COACHING:
1. Practice set plays that incorporate the highest-probability transitions identified in this analysis.
2. Focus on optimizing the number of events in offensive sequences to approximately 31.0 touches.
3. When trailing late in games, emphasize controlledentry as it leads to higher-quality shots in pressure situations.
4. Defensive strategy should focus on disrupting controlledentry to reduce opponent shot quality.
5. Consider using these patterns to predict and counter opponent offensive sequences.
