HOCKEY PASSING NETWORK ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=======================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
- Analyzed 3037 pass connections across 5 games
- Average time between pass and reception: 0.94 seconds

KEY FINDINGS:
1. TEAM PASSING NETWORKS:
   - Individual team networks have been generated showing key connectors
   - Player metrics calculated for each team identifying playmakers and outlets

2. ZONE ANALYSIS:
   - Defensive Zone Passes: Defensive: 80.1%, Neutral: 18.6%, Offensive: 1.3%, 
   - Neutral Zone Passes: Defensive: 27.8%, Neutral: 60.9%, Offensive: 11.3%, 
   - Offensive Zone Passes: Defensive: 0.0%, Neutral: 0.3%, Offensive: 99.7%, 

3. POSITIONAL ANALYSIS:
   - D passing tendencies: to D: 41.0%, to F: 58.9%, to G: 0.1%, 
   - F passing tendencies: to D: 50.0%, to F: 50.0%, to G: 0.1%, 
   - G passing tendencies: to D: 81.9%, to F: 18.1%, to G: 0.0%, 

4. SEQUENCE ANALYSIS:
   - Identified 1946 passing sequences
   - Average sequence length: 1.56 passes
   - Maximum sequence length: 9 passes
   - Most common sequence length: 1 passes

5. SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS:
   - Score and manpower situations show distinct passing patterns
   - Zone transitions vary based on game situation

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS:
1. Integrate with shot and scoring data to identify successful passing patterns
2. Compare passing networks across teams to identify stylistic differences
3. Analyze temporal changes in passing patterns during games
4. Examine passing networks in specific game situations (e.g., late game, when trailing)
5. Incorporate player tracking data for more precise positioning analysis
