- Average number of passes before a shot: 2.37

Shot success rate by number of preceding passes:
  0 pass(es): 74.1%
  1 pass(es): 54.1%
  2 pass(es): 51.7%
  3 pass(es): 54.0%
  4 pass(es): 50.0%
  5 pass(es): 63.9%
  6 pass(es): 60.0%

Shot distribution by zone:
  Offensive: 96.8%
  Neutral: 2.6%
  Defensive: 0.6%

2. GAME SITUATION ANALYSIS
-------------------------
Pass success rates by situation:
  - Overall: 74.4%
  - Late Game: 66.5%
  - Trailing: 73.2%
  - Leading: 76.4%

Passing in the last 2 minutes of regulation:
  - Number of passes: 134
  - Success rate: 67.9%

3. KEY FINDINGS
-------------
1. The relationship between passing and shooting success shows that [interpret your results]
2. Teams modify their passing strategy when trailing/leading, with [interpret differences]
3. Late game situations show [interpret late game patterns]
4. The most successful shot sequences typically involve [interpret shot sequence patterns]
5. Zone transitions vary significantly by game situation, particularly [note key differences]

4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
------------------------------------
1. Expand analysis to include face-offs and their relationship to passing sequences
2. Create player chemistry metrics based on successful passing connections
3. Develop predictive models for shot success based on pass characteristics
4. Analyze defensive disruptions of passing sequences
5. Investigate team-specific passing strategies and counter-strategies
